So far, I'm thinking about C-like, looking at CUDA as an example for a C-like language optimzed for hardware. Can you build something like that but it's optimized for riscv?

Looking at sorting algorithms, it seems like C++ is more efficient then C. What about other high level languages, rust/zig? 
* TODO: convert pdqsort into zig and rust, see how it works
* TODO: try to optimize pdqsort for C better, maybe ask for outside help
