Some wild ideas running through my head

Combining a few ideas; 

* Modern computer programs are really slow. Too much abstraction, languages and frameworks are based on vibes and hype
* C is the best language for low level programming, however has a lot of floaws. It is inherently single threaded, a bad design. Doesn't take advantage of vector instructions.
  - Look at CUDA; C-like language that has great low level support for parallel programming. Gives programmer a lot of control
  - Look at new C-like language; compare to CUDA, zig, Rust(?)
  - Only support RISCV(?) maybe ARM(?)
  - Simple scripting language on top; doubles as shell
* All modern OSes suck and are bloated
  - All you need is a browser and a terminal
  - can get a cool networking stack
* Cloud hosting pays kind of decent. Something comparable to a $3/month t2.nano is like $30
  - with a super efficient OS, efficient programming language, efficient networking stack and server, can make low cost low power compute as an investment
 
* More fleshed out; use encryption to protect OS source and some processes. Look into understanding some distributed ledger algorithms maybe?
